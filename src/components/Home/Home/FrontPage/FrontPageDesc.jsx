                An artist who has just recently learned about my passion in
                visual arts. In a short span of time,
                <br /> I learned about video and photo editing using software
                applications used by professionals. Creative. Team player. Able
                to work under time pressure. A graphic designer. I intend to
                expand my knowledge and gain more experiences in this career by
                joining your team.
